    <h2>Hello!</h2>

    <p>Welcome to the beta of my DCC Character Creator. This is a fan project and is in no way officially associated with Goodman Games (though they are quite fine peoples). </p>

    <p>This app will let you generate characters from levels 1-10. On generation, the characters are saved to a database. Hurray character permanence! When you view your character you can edit levels, stats, alignments, equipment, and most of the normal things that would happen during an adventure. As you make these edits, things will recalculate as needed (saving throws, titles, spells checks, etc). You can also output all that as a PDF! </p>

    <p>Being a beta, there are still some quirks to work out. Leveling up, and changing certain stats will auto-recalculate hit points and languages. While in edit mode you can go fill in your own values for this so it'll accurately reflect what should be seen. You'll just need to make sure you make a note of those original values before they get auto-calculated out of existence.</p>

    <p>One final note, since this is being hosted across a number of free services, sometimes the database goes to sleep. So don't panic if you log in and don't see your characters. The data is there, the database can just be groggy and needs the coffee to kick in when woken up. Just give it a minute and try logging in again.</p>
